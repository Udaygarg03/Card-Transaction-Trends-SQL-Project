# Card Transaction Trends â€“ SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on analyzing corporate card transactions using SQL. It demonstrates the use of key SQL concepts such as `JOINs`, `CTEs`, `aggregations`, `window functions`, and `date functions` to extract meaningful insights from transactional data. The analysis identifies spending patterns, detects anomalies, and monitors card usage across departments and time periods.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

The project uses a relational schema with the following CSV-based tables:

- `employees` â€“ Contains employee ID, name, department, and location.
- `merchants` â€“ Includes merchant ID, category, and vendor details.
- `transactions` â€“ Corporate card transactions with timestamps, amounts, employee IDs, and merchant IDs.

> All datasets have been cleaned and contain over 200 rows for meaningful analysis.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- âœ… SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, SELF)
- âœ… Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- âœ… Aggregations & Grouping (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- âœ… Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `OVER`)
- âœ… Filtering (`WHERE`, `HAVING`)
- âœ… Subqueries & Derived Tables
- âœ… Date-Time Analysis (monthly, quarterly trends)

## ðŸ“Š Business Questions Answered

- What are the monthly transaction trends across departments?
- Who are the top spenders?
- Which merchants receive the highest volume of transactions?
- Are there any suspicious or unusually large transactions?
- What is the average transaction size by department and category?

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)** â€“ for SQL querying
- **Tableau (Optional)** â€“ for visualization and dashboard building

## ðŸ§¾ Example SQL Snippets

```sql
-- Monthly spend by department
WITH monthly_spend AS (
  SELECT 
    e.department,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', t.transaction_date) AS month,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent
  FROM transactions t
  JOIN employees e ON t.employee_id = e.employee_id
  GROUP BY e.department, month
)
SELECT * FROM monthly_spend
ORDER BY month;
